I can't believe this ####. Every single time we try to get something done,
some ####### screws it up. It's like we're surrounded by idiots who don't know their #####
from their elbows. This whole situation is just a big ####### mess, and I'm so sick and tired
of dealing with this ########. How the #### are we supposed to make any progress when
everything gets ######### by these ######?
I'm about ready to lose my #### with all the #### incompetence around here.
